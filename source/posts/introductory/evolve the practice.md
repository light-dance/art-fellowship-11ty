Art Fellowship is an ['Open Source'](https://www.britannica.com/topic/open-source) practice, made available for free. The practice was conceived of and developed by Alexandra Zachary, an educator and psychologist, and it's grown into a global community.
</br>We claim no special ownership of "Art Fellowship" and you're free&mdash;*encouraged!*&mdash;to take the resources here and start your own practice.

The best way to start is to experience a facilitated Art Fellowship practice. [Sign up](/get-started). You can learn more about the intentions and considerations in the [Practice Design](/design) paper and you can view an in-depth guide for practice and facilitation [here](/guide).

**Local Groups:** we want to support local groups. We plan to offer features on this website in the future to help people connect, schedule, and facilitate in-person local groups.

**Experiments:** our Community Practice hosts experimental sessions for trying new things like practicing around a movie, adding in a movement meditation, or other variations. If you have an idea, contact us and we'll add it to the practice schedule.

**New Practices:** you can of course use this practice as inspiration or a starting point for developing new practices.

**Facilitate:** If you want to help us facilitate through this website, [contact us](/about#contact). If you want to facilitate Art Fellowship practice on your own, independent of this site, we ask that you follow some guidelines:
- First, be honest in your promotion of your events. This practice has real benefits but is not therapy and can pose risks to sensitive individuals. Some of these risks have been documented in our Practice Design paper, please be familiar with these. 
- We have chosen not to charge for our facilitation, but you're free to make a different decision. If you do charge for your facilitated practice, you must reference our website as the source of the practice you're offering.
- Do not attempt to impersonate us/this site. Be clear that you are independent from this website and our facilitators.
